    "##### I put my materials for this in the folder titled \"HW1 Question 2\". This is code I made to construct a DCD recoil curve. A DC demagnetization (DCD) recoil curve measures how a magnetic materialâ€™s magnetization decreases when it is progressively demagnetized from saturation by applying reverse fields. You first saturate the sample in a positive field, then stepwise apply increasing negative fields, measuring the remanent magnetization at each step with a magnetometer. The code takes the raw magnetometer data (in the form of an input file in the \"recoilcurves_input\" folder, I have provided an example file) and looks for local mimimums and maximums so that only the final point of remanent magnetization at each setting of applied magnetic field (Oe) is kept. It then graphs this data to give a preliminary view of results and exports the resulting values as an excel sheet (to the \"recoilcurves_output\" folder) for further data processing. You must run the code with the respective folders aptly named to generate an output file."

    "##### This is now my fourth (or maybe fifth) course that I have taken that either directly teahces python concepts or incorporated them into the curriculum somehow. I have actually used some of those YouTube channels before to help me undertsand some concepts (I think mCoding is the one I have seen the most in the past). Under the \"Useful Summaries and Blog Posts\" section, I have certainly used some of these tips and tricks before in my coding, I just have to remember them now because it has been a couple months/years in some cases. Truncating decimal places, splicing lists, identifying string elements, etc. are all very helpful, and I will probably use them all again once I need them. As for the other free Python courses, I think this one is enough for now. I will visit those in the future if ever I am very stuck or want to advance my python skills even further. "
